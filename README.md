# [Live preview](https://alpalma95.github.io/trivialNight/)

Honestly? I hate Trivial. A bunch of friends of mine want to play it tonight, so I agreed only if we don't play with the board and kill the time playing darts as well. This little project will help to roll the dice and to keep track of the scores.

In the future, I would like to:

1. Re-factor de code as I did this really in a hurry ðŸ˜…
2. Add new functionalities like:
   - Select the number of players
   - Assign each player an emoji
3. In general, work on this interface, as most likely we'll use this a lot. Otherwise I will not play any other form of Trivial.
